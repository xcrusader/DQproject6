    "Employment in the old days was for a life time. You got in to an organization and you were a lifer. The thought of resigning was incomprehensible.\n",

    "Today, that trend has flipped. There are just a handful of organization with a low employee turnover. If employees do stay they, eventually get laid off because of some cost cutting initiative. The reasons for leaving may be many. Some leave to improve themselves, others leave because they do not see any prospect for growth and still some others leave because of dissatisfaction.\n",

The project aims to explore a **modified** data set of exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The original datasets can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)\n",

    "This could be because more established employees have far less oppurtunities outside the organization and are more sensitive to any thing that they percieve as wrong from the employer's perspective. Over time they have developed a perception of the \"right way\" and their experience may have cemented that perception. \n",
